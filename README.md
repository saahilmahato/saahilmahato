Hi, I’m Saahil 👋

Software engineer who likes building simple, reliable things and learning how systems work.

Tech I use

Go, JavaScript / TypeScript, C++

SvelteKit (frontend), Go Fiber (backend)

My profile is a mix of projects, experiments, and learning notes.
Just code, progress, and the occasional bug.

Thanks for stopping by ✌️
