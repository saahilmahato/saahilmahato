Full-stack engineer from Nepal.

I spend my days keeping large distributed systems fast, secure, and (mostly) awake.  
I get a strange satisfaction from turning legacy monoliths into something maintainers don’t hate, making APIs feel instant, and watching CI stay green.

When I’m not shipping production code, I’m usually lost in side projects involving AI, simulation environments, or whatever rabbit hole sounded fun at 11 PM.

Currently obsessed with:
- Systems that scale without drama
- Security that doesn’t feel like a band-aid
- Clean architecture and boring-but-reliable solutions

Always happy to talk about backend design, distributed systems, security at scale, or why your tests are slow.

Say hello — email, DM, issue, or random star. I notice all of them 😄
